Hi! 

I am a spatial software engineer (VR, AR, XR). I am passionate about swift development. 
In my free time I work on several swift project. Most of them are small and target one main feature. I intend to use them as support for youtube tutorials.
I also work on a big project that is actually an agregation of my other small projects.

# AppleDevelopInSwiftTutorials
Develop in Swift Tutorial is a series of tutorials made by Apple in 2024.

This project merges the first 7 chapters/tutorials of [Develop in Swift Tutorial](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/develop-in-swift) in a single application named PartyCompanion.
Each chapter can be run independently of each other.

For the moment ChatPrototype and WeatherForecast are not part of PartyCompanion because they are hard coded. To make these two chapters more attractive, I plan to integrate Multipeer Connectivity and WeatherKit frameworks.

Party Companion will help you organize a game or movie session with your friends.
